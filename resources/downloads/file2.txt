2/ Coding exercise
Implement a File server & Download Manager (CLI)
Requirements for the server:
- Use of sockets over TCP/IP
- serve a list of available files (of arbitrary format) from a specified
directory (and subdirectories)
- supported commands:
+ "index" to list out all the available files
+ "get <file-name>". Response with either "ok" or "error":
The "ok" message will be followed with the content of the file
The "error" message indicates that the specified file does not exist on
the server
+ "quit" or "q" to quit for the client program
+ "unknown command" response for others
Requirements for the client:
- issue server-supported commands and handle responses
- select a file to download
