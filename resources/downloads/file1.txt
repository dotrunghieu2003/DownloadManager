1/ System design
With current pandemic, teachers are forced to provide their lessons to students
via Internet. Your task is to design a Learning Management System (LMS) to assist a
high school teacher in providing the courses online. The system at minimum should
have
* Functional requirement
- Ability for teacher to add course material such as slides, video, audio clip
and online quiz
- Ability to allow student to register to the course with email address, view the
available material and submit quiz and writing assignment
- Teacher can view each student record and course progress i.e complete 3 out of
5 quiz
* Some non-functional requirements
- Class can have up to 40 students per course but there could be used by multiple
teachers so the system should be able to scale up and handle high load i.e final
exam where all student need to log in and doing online exam in real time
* Delivery expectation
- Design documents such as Entity relation diagram
- List of components and their purposes
- Technology stack you would like to use
- UI is not a strong focus
